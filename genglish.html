        <h4>
        Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an upcoming tax system in India that integrates several separate taxes into a single tax.<p> It was introduced as the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016 under the 122nd Amendment Bill. The GST Council, chaired by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, administers the goods and services tax.

        GST is a comprehensive indirect tax levied on the manufacture, sale and consumption of goods and services instead of taxes levied by the Central and State Governments across India.</p>
        
        Under this scheme GST-registered businesses can avail tax exemption on GST value on common goods and services purchased as part of their commercial transactions. The management responsibility for taxing goods and services is usually vested in a single officer. 
        <p> [1] Exports are treated as zero-rated supplies, with imports 
            subject to non-GST customs duty, as well as GST on domestic goods and services.</p>
        
        The introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an important development in reforming the indirect tax system in India. Creating multiple central and state taxes as a single tax
        <p> [2]  solves problems such as double taxation, making a single national common market possible. Tax simplicity makes administration and implementation easier. From a consumer perspective, the total tax burden on goods is 
            expected to be reduced by 25 to 30 per cent, with hours of non-stop transportation of tax payments from one state to another across state borders, and large-scale cuts.</p>
        
        
       <h3><p> Advantages of Goods and Services Tax (GST):</p></h3>
        
      <p>  1. Tax simplification can lead to lower prices. Poor states benefit. Revenue from the center used to go to the richest states, mostly because of the industries in those states, but that is not the case now.</p>
        
       <p>2. Implementation of GST is expected to increase government revenue and increase economic growth to around 2%. One estimate is that domestic exports could also grow by 10% to 14%.</p>
        
      <p>  3. Tax evasion will be reduced and many traders will come under tax coverage GST registration will be facilitated so many traders can do business in India.</p>
        
      <p> 4. Increases consumer spending revenue . This means that for the most part, falling commodity prices make it possible for people to have money to spend on their income without taxes. In addition, manufacturers and exporters will benefit and competitiveness will increase.</p>
        
      <p> 5. Consumers should not be deceived by transparency in taxes. Moreover, it is now possible to make a mandatory bill for their purchases after the implementation of GST and this will also reduce the financial burden on them. In addition, all states benefit from a "single tax system".</p>
        
      <p>6. Corruption in tax collection will decrease.</p>
       7. Black money in the country will decrease as the chances of tax evasion decrease.
