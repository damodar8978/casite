  <h2> <b> <i>BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES UNDER EPF SCHEME</i></b></h2>

Employee Provident Fund is a very important investment for the necessities of our future. The tax free interest and the maturity award ensure a very good growth to your money. If the PF money continued for a very long period of time, it can help in meeting employee's requirements including his retirement goals.

We often fall short of funds during emergencies and at those moments borrowing is the only option left. At this time the EPF can be very helpful because the kinds of benefits it provides no other investment can offer the similar remunerations: The PF can be used for multiple purposes at different moments as it guarantees benefits such as:

Accumulation plus interest upon retirement, resignation and death
Partial withdrawals allowed for specific expenses such as house construction, higher education, marriage, illness etc.
Any person joining an establishment, to which the EPF & MP Act applies, shall compulsorily submit a declaration to his/her employer, whether he/she is already a member of Provident Fund (Form 11 (15.1 KB)- PDF file that ope
