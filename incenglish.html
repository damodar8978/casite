     <h4>   Domestic taxes can be classified into direct taxes and indirect taxes.
          Direct tax is a tax paid directly to the government on your income. <p>Indirect taxes are taxes levied on you and paid to the government by someone else on your behalf. For example, hotels, movie theaters, etc. 
          fall into this category.</p> They will collect the taxes you owe on the products or services you purchase and pay them to the government on your behalf. Direct taxes can be classified into two types, income tax and corporate tax.

<p>Income tax- Individuals or non-Hindu family members (HUFs) or companies other than taxpayers are liable to pay income tax on their own income. The law dictates how much tax should be paid on how much income.

Corporate tax - The tax that companies pay on their profits is treated as corporate tax. Relevant laws dictate the amount of tax that must be paid.</p>

<h3>Earnings vary .. </h3>
Income can be of many types. Salary, pension or savings accounts, interest on fixed deposits, rent on leased property, funds, cash on delivery of shares, business, cash, professional income, etc.,
 all fall under income. Eventually the winners of events like Kaun Banega Crorepati will also have to pay income tax on the prize amount.

 <h3>In different slabs ..</h3>
<p>There are different types of tax slabs for different categories of taxpayers as per the domestic income tax laws.
 While companies have a fixed level of corporate tax based on their level, other categories (individuals, HUFs, etc.)</p> are taxed according to the slabs applied to their revenues. 
 According to the 2021 figures, there are four types of slabs depending on the income of the individual. 
<p> Rs. Those with an income of up to Rs 2.5 lakh can earn up to Rs. 2.5 lakh to Rs. Those up to Rs 5 lakh will get the second slab, Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. Another up to Rs 10 lakh, Rs. Another slab is being applied for those above 10 lakh.</p>

In addition to taxing gross income, there are incentives for things like insurance and savings, as well as exemptions for certain types of expenses. It is possible to reduce the tax burden by disclosing the details.
 The government has also introduced a new tax system for those who give up certain exemptions.
